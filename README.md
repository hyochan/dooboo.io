## Project Overview

The project aimed at providing a comprehensive and visual representation of a developer's potential based on six key attributes. These attributes are tree, fire, earth, gold, water, and people. Each of these attributes symbolizes a different aspect of a developer's skill set, personality, and overall potential. The six attributes are described as follows:

### Tree (Curiosity)

This attribute represents a developer's inquisitiveness and their ability to continuously learn new things. A high tree score indicates that the developer is proactive in seeking knowledge and exploring new technologies or methods.

### Fire (Passion)
This attribute embodies a developer's enthusiasm and dedication to their craft. A high fire score signifies that the developer is genuinely passionate about programming and driven to create, innovate, and excel in their work.

### Earth (Patience and Persistence)
This attribute represents a developer's ability to remain patient and persistent in the face of challenges. A high earth score indicates that the developer has the tenacity to keep pushing forward, even when encountering obstacles or setbacks.

### Gold (Achievements)
This attribute showcases a developer's accomplishments, such as completed projects, recognition within the industry, or other tangible milestones. A high gold score highlights the developer's success and ability to deliver results.

### Water (Wisdom and Insights)
This attribute represents a developer's capacity to apply their knowledge and experience effectively. A high water score indicates that the developer has gained valuable insights from their experiences and can make wise decisions in their work.

### People (Average of 5 elements)
This attribute serves as an overall representation of a developer's potential. It is calculated by averaging the scores of the other five attributes, with water and gold being more heavily weighted to emphasize their importance.

By assessing and visualizing these six attributes, the `github-stats`, the Developer Power Meter project aims to provide a holistic view of a developer's potential. This tool can help both individuals and organizations to understand a developer's strengths and weaknesses, allowing for better collaboration, professional development, and more informed hiring decisions.

For a deeper understanding of this philosophy, you can refer to a [blog post](https://medium.com/dooboolab/a-new-fancy-way-to-visualize-your-github-stats-418b5d59498) that provides further insight and discussion.

Many people have asked me how to become a developer that companies desire or how to become a good developer. After reflecting on the general form of my responses and incorporating my 10 years of experience, I have formulated a comprehensive philosophy within the current framework.

This philosophy is composed of six elements, symbolized by a hexagon, which represents a flexible tofu-like substance. In Korean, tofu is called "dooboo" (ÎëêÎ∂Ä), and it signifies a soft, adaptable, and growth-oriented individual, embodying the ideal qualities of a developer.

If you find this philosophy appealing and believe that you embody these qualities, please feel free to reach out to me. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect with you. You can contact me by emailing <a href="mailto:hyo@dooboolab.com">hyo@dooboolab.com</a>.

We have a vision of people leading fulfilling and rewarding lives, using their time efficiently and embracing life's challenges. We are dedicated to helping individuals experience a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in their achievements.
